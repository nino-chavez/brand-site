## Health Dimensions (7)

### Dimension Summary Table

| # | Dimension | Weight | Current | Target | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Configuration | 10% | 7.5/10 | 8.5/10 | 🟡 Good |
| 2 | Architecture | 15% | 9.0/10 | 9.0/10 | 🟢 Excellent |
| 3 | Test Coverage | 15% | 8.5/10 | 8.5/10 | 🟢 Excellent |
| 4 | Documentation | 10% | 8.0/10 | 8.5/10 | 🟢 Very Good |
| 5 | Features | 15% | 9.5/10 | 9.0/10 | 🟢 Outstanding |
| 6 | Technical Debt | 20% | 7.0/10 | 8.0/10 | 🟡 Good |
| 7 | Production Readiness | 15% | 9.0/10 | 9.0/10 | 🟢 Excellent |

**Overall Score:** 8.3/10 🟢 **EXCELLENT**

### Calculation Formula

```typescript
Overall = (Config × 0.10) + (Arch × 0.15) + (Tests × 0.15) +
          (Docs × 0.10) + (Features × 0.15) + (Debt × 0.20) +
          (Prod × 0.15)

Overall = (7.5 × 0.10) + (9.0 × 0.15) + (8.5 × 0.15) +
          (8.0 × 0.10) + (9.5 × 0.15) + (7.0 × 0.20) +
          (9.0 × 0.15)

Overall = 0.75 + 1.35 + 1.28 + 0.80 + 1.43 + 1.40 + 1.35
Overall = 8.36 ≈ 8.3/10
```

## Usage Patterns

### For Developers

**Before Starting Work:**
```bash
# Check current project health
npm run health

# Review detailed metrics
npm run health:verbose

# Expected output:
# Overall Health Score: 8.3/10 - EXCELLENT
# [7-dimension breakdown]
# [Critical actions if any]
```

**After Completing Work:**
```bash
# Validate no regressions
npm run health:verbose

# If score drops >0.5 points:
# - Review recent changes
# - Address critical actions
# - Update PROJECT_HEALTH.md
```

### For CI/CD

**GitHub Actions Integration:**
```yaml
# Runs automatically on:
# 1. Weekly schedule (Sundays 00:00 UTC)
# 2. Push to main branch
# 3. Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)

# Workflow behavior:
# - Runs npm run health:json
# - Uploads reports as artifacts
# - Fails if score <7.0/10
# - Warns if score <7.5/10
# - Creates GitHub issue (weekly, if <7.5)
# - Commits historical reports
```

**Local CI Simulation:**
```bash
# Simulate CI health check
npm run health:json > health-report.json
cat health-report.json | jq '.overall'

# Check if would pass CI
SCORE=$(cat health-report.json | jq -r '.overall')
if (( $(echo "$SCORE < 7.0" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "Would fail CI"
else
  echo "Would pass CI"
fi
```

### For AI Agents

**Proactive Assessment (Pre-Flight):**
```
User: "Refactor the canvas system"
Agent: "Running health check before refactoring..."
Agent: [Executes: npm run health]
Agent: "Current health: 8.3/10. All systems green."
Agent: "Safe to proceed with refactoring."
```

**Post-Work Validation (Post-Flight):**
```
User: "Completed authentication system"
Agent: "Running health check to validate changes..."
Agent: [Executes: npm run health]
Agent: "Health maintained at 8.3/10."
Agent: "No regressions detected. ✅"
```

**Regression Detection:**
```
Agent: [Detects score drop from 8.3 to 7.7]
Agent: "⚠️ Health regression detected!"
Agent: "Score dropped from 8.3 to 7.7 (-0.6 points)"
Agent: "Affected dimension: Technical Debt (7.0 → 6.2)"
Agent: "Recommend reviewing recent changes"
```

## Thresholds & Alerts

| Threshold | Score | Action | Alert Level |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Critical** | <7.0 | CI fails, blocks merge | 🔴 |
| **Warning** | <7.5 | GitHub issue created | 🟡 |
| **Target** | 8.5 | Standard production goal | 🟢 |
| **Excellent** | >9.0 | Celebration-worthy | ✨ |

**Current Status:** 8.3/10 - Above warning threshold, approaching target

## Verification

To verify the health monitoring system works:

### 1. Test CLI Commands

```bash
# Standard report
npm run health

# Should output:
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════
#          PROJECT HEALTH REPORT
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Overall Health Score: 8.3/10 - EXCELLENT
# ...

# Verbose report
npm run health:verbose

# JSON report
npm run health:json | jq '.overall'
# Should output: 8.3
```

### 2. Test CI/CD Workflow

```bash
# Validate workflow syntax
gh workflow view health-monitoring.yml

# Manually trigger workflow
gh workflow run health-monitoring.yml

# Check workflow status
gh run list --workflow=health-monitoring.yml
```

### 3. Test Agent Integration

```
# Via Claude Code or AI assistant
User: "check health"
Agent: [Should execute health check and report score]

User: "what's our current health score?"
Agent: [Should reference PROJECT_HEALTH.md]
```

---

## Rollback Plan
