# Product Roadmap

> Last Updated: 2025-09-30
> Version: 3.2.0
> Status: Alpha - Local Development Only
> Environment: Not in production, no deployment scheduled

## Strategic Vision: "The Lens & Lightbox"

A photography-metaphor-driven portfolio where the interaction itself showcases technical thinking through two unified systems:

1. **The Lens** (Navigation) - Zero-occlusion cursor-activated radial menu
2. **The Lightbox** (Content Canvas) - 2D cinematic pan-and-zoom content exploration

**Why This Works:** Instead of traditional web patterns, users experience a photographer's workflow—using a lens to focus on content arranged on a lightbox canvas. The interaction IS the demonstration of skill.

## Strategic Focus

**Current State:** The portfolio has **partial alpha functionality**. Traditional mode works with cursor navigation. Canvas mode is **non-functional** due to critical React hooks architecture issues discovered during user testing (2025-09-30).

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ Phase 1 "The Lens": Zero-occlusion cursor navigation (100% complete, works in traditional mode)
- 🔴 Phase 2 "The Lightbox": 2D canvas system (62.5% complete, **canvas mode broken**)
- ✅ Phase 3 "Content Integration": Portfolio content optimized (98.9% complete)
- ⚠️ Phase 3.5 "Validation & Testing": **Invalidated** - validation was premature
- ✅ Bonus Achievement: Standalone gallery system (93.75% complete, functional)

**Completion Metrics:**
- 89/90 tasks complete across Phase 3 specifications (98.9%)
- Net code reduction: -2,451 lines (-71% from canvas refactor)
- Build performance: 17.3% faster (2.37s → 1.96s)
- Test coverage: 215+ tests passing
- Gallery with 66 E2E tests
- Phase 2 validation: 24/27 acceptance criteria fully met (88.9%)

**Next Priority:** 🔴 **URGENT** - Canvas Mode Remediation (2 weeks, P0)

**Development Status:**
- **Alpha complete:** 🔴 No - canvas mode completely non-functional
- **Validation complete:** ⚠️ Invalidated - Phase 3.5 validation was premature without manual testing
- **Test coverage:** 🟡 Insufficient - unit tests pass but integration broken
- **Performance:** ⚠️ Cannot measure - canvas mode doesn't work

**Immediate Action Required:**
1. Execute remediation spec: `.agent-os/specs/2025-09-30-canvas-mode-remediation/`
2. Fix 6 critical React hooks architecture issues
3. Complete proper manual end-to-end testing
4. Validate canvas mode actually works in browser

## Changelog

### Version 3.3.0 (2025-09-30) - CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED

**Major Changes:**
1. **Phase 2 Status Corrected:** "Complete" → "Broken - Requires Remediation"
   - Reality check: Canvas mode is completely non-functional
   - Discovered during user testing on 2025-09-30
   - Core implementation done (10/10 tasks) but doesn't work
   - Validation tasks (6/6) never actually completed
   - Marked complete prematurely without manual testing

2. **Root Cause Identified:** Systemic React Hooks Architecture Issues
   - Circular dependencies between useCursorTracking and useUnifiedPerformance
   - Unmemoized hook returns causing infinite render loops
   - Over-coupled useEffect dependencies
   - Pointer events preventing activation (catch-22)
   - Missing cursor position on activation

3. **Remediation Spec Created:** Complete fix plan documented
   - See `.agent-os/specs/2025-09-30-canvas-mode-remediation/`
   - 12 tasks across 3 phases
   - Estimated effort: 2 weeks (42 hours)
   - Priority: P0 - Critical blocking issue
   - Includes comprehensive testing and validation

4. **Technical Debt Documented:** 5 critical debt items registered
   - TD-001: Circular dependency (6h fix)
   - TD-002: Unmemoized hooks (12h fix)
   - TD-003: Over-coupled effects (8h fix)
   - TD-004: Pointer events (2h fix)
   - TD-005: Missing cursor position (2h fix)

5. **Phase 3.5 Validation Invalidated:**
   - Validation was premature - canvas mode never actually tested
   - Unit tests passed but integration completely broken
   - Evidence-based validation insufficient without manual testing
   - Cross-browser test plan exists but not executed
   - Performance cannot be validated when feature doesn't work

**Impact:**
- Alpha is NOT complete as previously claimed
- Traditional mode works, canvas mode does not
- Invalidates previous "production ready" assertions
- Blocks progress until remediation complete

**Lessons Learned:**
1. Unit tests passing ≠ feature working
2. Manual end-to-end testing is mandatory
3. Validation cannot be "evidence-based" without actual browser testing
4. React hooks architecture must be validated, not assumed
5. Marking tasks "complete" requires functional verification

**Next Steps:**
- Execute canvas mode remediation spec
- Implement proper manual testing protocol
- Fix all React hooks anti-patterns
- Validate canvas mode actually works before marking complete

### Version 3.2.0 (2025-09-30)

**Major Changes:**
1. **Updated Environment Status:** Production language → Alpha/Local Development
   - Status: "Production-ready" → "Alpha - Local Development Only"
   - Environment: "Not in production, no deployment scheduled"
   - Removed production deployment sections and checklists
   - Clarified all "production-ready" language to "functionally complete in local environment"

2. **Phase 2 Status Updated:** "Production-ready" → "Implementation complete"
   - Development Status: "✅ Production-ready and validated" → "✅ Implementation complete, validated in local environment"
   - Metrics: Updated production readiness language to development status

3. **Phase 3.5 Language Clarified:** Production focus → Local validation focus
   - Goal: "achieve full production confidence" → "validate implementation in local development environment"
   - Status: "Production deployment approved" → "Local validation complete"
   - Success Criteria: Removed production deployment language
   - Results: "PRODUCTION READY" → "IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE"
   - Optional enhancements clarified as not required for alpha

4. **Phase 4 Simplified:** Removed production scaling focus
   - Goal: "Professional production deployment" → "Enhanced interactive features"
   - Removed PWA, professional client features, SEO (production-focused)
   - Kept: Advanced canvas effects, enhanced interactions, visual polish
   - Dependencies: Removed hosting infrastructure requirements

5. **Strategic Focus Updated:**
   - Current state: "production-ready and validated" → "functionally complete in alpha"
   - Next priority: "Production deployment" → "Phase 4 or continue refining"
   - Development status: Focused on alpha completion, not production deployment

**Rationale:**
Application is in alpha/local development only. Production deployment sections were creating unnecessary focus on deployment tasks that aren't relevant at this stage.
