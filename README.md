# Nino Chavez Portfolio: "What I Build When Nobody's Watching"

A cutting-edge personal portfolio website built entirely with AI-powered development tools, demonstrating production-grade multi-agent development methodology through personal projects and open-source contributions.

## About This Project

Two decades architecting Fortune 500 commerce platformsâ€”where downtime costs millions and "good enough" fails. I can't show you that work. What I can show: this portfolio (5 AI agents, 97/100 Lighthouse, automated quality gates), a real-time volleyball platform, and projects solving problems I'm not paid to solve.

This isn't a showcase of client work (bound by NDAs). It's a demonstration of **AI-first development methodology** through personal projects that reveal how I think, build, and solve problems.

### Featured Personal Projects

This portfolio showcases 5 production-grade personal projects:

1. **Multi-Agent Development Platform** (This Site) - 5 AI agents, 97/100 Lighthouse, automated quality gates
2. **MatchFlow** - Real-time volleyball tournament platform with 137 services, 88/100 production readiness
3. **Aegis Framework** - First-in-industry AI agent governance framework with constitutional enforcement
4. **SmugMug API Reference App** - Built in 72 hours, 20x velocity multiplier, AI-powered semantic search
5. **Commerce Prompt Analyzer** - Answer engine optimization tool for e-commerce catalog analysis

### Photography Metaphor Navigation

The UI follows a camera-inspired workflow with six sections representing the photography process:

1. **Capture** (Hero) - Camera viewfinder interface
2. **Focus** (About) - Professional background and expertise
3. **Frame** (Projects) - Personal project showcase
4. **Exposure** (Insights) - Technical writing and thought leadership
5. **Develop** (Gallery) - Action sports photography
6. **Portfolio** (Contact) - Professional connection hub

## My AI Development Team

This project showcases the future of software development through **100% AI-powered collaboration**. Every line of code, design decision, and architectural choice has been the result of human-AI partnership:

### Core AI Agents

- **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai)** - Primary coding assistant and architectural planning
- **[Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google/gemini-cli)** - Secondary assistant for debugging and code review
- **[Amazon Kiro IDE](https://aws.amazon.com/kiro/)** - Advanced IDE features and development workflows
- **[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)** - Real-time code completion and pair programming
- **[Cursor AI](https://cursor.sh)** - Intelligent code editing and refactoring

### Enhanced Agent-OS Framework

I've significantly enhanced the open-source [Agent-OS framework](https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os) by integrating **Amazon Kiro's internal prompting and specification methodology** to create a sophisticated AI collaboration system:

**What Agent-OS Provides:**

- Structured specification creation with formal acceptance criteria
- Task breakdown methodology with incremental building approach
- Quality gates and requirement traceability
- Collaborative development workflows

**My Kiro-Enhanced Additions:**

- **Enhanced Task Creation** - 4-phase implementation with early testing priority
- **Comprehensive Context Awareness** - Agents read ALL spec documents for complete implementation context
- **Iterative Validation** - Real-time approval loops for quality assurance
- **Multi-Agent Coordination** - Specialized agents for git workflows, testing, and project management
- **Kiro Internal Prompting Patterns** - Adopted Kiro's internal specification and prompting approach for enhanced agent performance

**Key Agent Specializations:**
- `context-fetcher` - Intelligent information retrieval from documentation
- `file-creator` - Template-based file generation with proper structure
- `git-workflow` - Automated branch management and PR creation
- `test-runner` - Comprehensive test execution and failure analysis
- `project-manager` - Task completion verification and roadmap maintenance

### AI-First Development Benefits

This approach has enabled:
- **Rapid Feature Development** - Complete features from spec to deployment in hours
- **Consistent Code Quality** - AI-enforced patterns and standards across all components
- **Comprehensive Testing** - AI-generated test suites with high coverage
- **Living Documentation** - Self-maintaining specs and architectural decisions
- **Performance Optimization** - AI-driven analysis of bundle size and runtime performance
